## About KiteSync

#### KiteSync Enables Developers to Sync Offline-First Applications Using Realm

We believe that offline-first applications make for the best user experience: 
- Applications should work offline as seamlessly as possible with little or no disruption to the user.
- Once a user is authenticated and online, his/her data should be synchronized and persistent on the device.
- Apps should provide syncronization across multiple devices.

Products like _Evernote, Google Keep,_ and _Kindle_ have syncing solutions that highlight the merits of ensuring user data is available across devices and have thus raised users' expectations of how they interact with their mobile apps. Syncing is a challenging technical problem and many businesses have developed proprietary syncing technology that can be used as a competitive advantage. KiteSyncâ€™s goal is to make syncing an easy experience both for developers and users alike.

Realm provides an exciting mobile database with a low memory and space footprint. We built an API wrapper over Realm to give full remote syncing functionality for react-native apps.


## What is KiteSync?

KiteSync is an open-source solution to syncing realm.io react-native databases by using an external remote service. This library empowers developers to focus on offline first functionality in their mobile apps.

KiteSync is built on top of [Realm.io](https://realm.io/) and consists of
two components:

- [__KiteSync Api__](/lib) -- a JavaScript library that allows syncing by using create, delete, update, and delete methods.     Syncing is initiated via the sync method coordinating synchronization with the remote service.
- [__KiteSync Remote-Service__](/lib) -- a cloud-based solution for adding
  applications.


KiteSync provides the following service to developers:

- __Full Sync__ -- provides a full synchronization of user data from mobile device to mobile device.
- __Auth__ -- an authentication API that connects to common auth providers (Facebook).
- __Incremental Sync__ -- only synchronizes changes since the users last sync reducing the amount of data transferred.
- __Conflict Management__ -- resolves conflicts between identical objects on the client's device.
- __Testing__ -- automated testing suite and sample test app to interface with the both databases.
- [__Proof-of-Concept Application__](/examples/ReactNativeIOSNotes) -- a production notes application that leverages the node module.

KiteSync was first built by [Alamu Palaniappan](https://github.com/alamuv), [Colin Goltra](https://github.com/gltr), [David Ogor](https://github.com/doctown), and [Mike Jonas](https://github.com/mikejonas)


## Getting Started
###Requirements
- realm
- react-native

###Installation
```sh
$ npm install realm-sync-js
```

(Link to realm-sync-js on NPM)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/realm-sync-js]

###API Documentation
You can use KiteSync methods in a similar manner to how you would use realm CRUD methods.

__new RealmSync(schema[, path])__

Instantiate an instance of realm and realm sync.

__.create(type, properties[, update])__

Create an object that can be synchronized.

__.delete(realmObject)__

Delete an object from the local realm storage database. 

__.getRealmInstance()__

Provides an instantiated instance of the Realm library.

__.sync(callback [,serviceWinsPolicy])__

Synchronizes changes with remote service based on . Node style callback that return true for success.

##Example
```js
const Realm = require('realm');
const RealmSync = require('kitesync');
// Create your schema
var PersonSchema = {}
PersonSchema.schema = {
  name: 'Person',
  properties: {
    name: String,
    address: String
  }
}
// Instantiate KiteSync

const realmSync = RealmSync([PersonSchema]);
const realm = realmSync.getRealmInstance();

// Function used to create a person in realm
realm.write(() => {
  realmSync.create('Person', {
    name: 'Brian Smith',
    address: '123 Main St'
  });
});

realmSync.sync(function(error, success) {
  if (error) throw new Error(error);
  console.log(success);
});
```

## Development & Contributing

### Get Involved

This library was made possible by the creative efforts of developers like you and
we would be happy to have you contribute to KiteSync's future success. If you'd like to be a contributor,
check out our [Contributing guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Also, checkout out [KiteSync.io](http://KiteSync.io) periodically for updates.


### Git Workflow

### Testing

### Style Guide

### Roadmap & Wishlist
- __Public/Private Routing__ -- allows developers to choose which data is privately synced per user and data synced to all mobile users.
- __Event Notification__ -- provides notification when syncing is initialized, in progress, and completed.
- __Backend Expansion__ -- an API/protocol to create custom backend solution.
